PHP-Data-Structures
===================

This is my attempt at recreating most if not all the data structures I have learned from my Data Structures Class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champiagn.

The class was taught in C++, but I decided to enhance my object oriented PHP skills and take on this task.
